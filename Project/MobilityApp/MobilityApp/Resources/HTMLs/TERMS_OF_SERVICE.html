        <li><b>Governing Law; Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</b>. These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of
            California without regard to conflict of law principles. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the
            Service or these Terms must be commenced within one year after the claim arose and <b>WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING
                ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. ANY
                SUCH CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM WILL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND WILL NOT BE CONSOLIDATED IN ANY
                ARBITRATION WITH ANY CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY OF ANY OTHER PARTY</b>. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa
            Clara County, California and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court of competent
            jurisdiction. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except
            as permitted by California law. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any court of
            competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect the party's rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise
            limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions
            through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief
            in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. To
            the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and the Foundation agree to submit to
            the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Santa Clara County,
            California for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.

            written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any
            provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach
            or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or
            a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and shall not have
            any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be
            invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the
            remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its
            nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to,
            Sections 1, 3, 4, and 6 through 17.
